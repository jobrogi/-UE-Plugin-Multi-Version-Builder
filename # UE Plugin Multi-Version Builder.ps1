# UE Plugin Multi-Version Builder
# -------------------------------

# Steps to use this script:
# 1. After Developing Plugin Place Plugin folder in the desktop folder.
#    This minimizes the path character length. Too many characters and the build will fail.
# 2. Edit this scriptâ€™s pluginRoot + outputRoot + outputName variables.
# 3. Ensure $versions match your installed Unreal Engine paths.

# Set plugin root path here
$pluginRoot = "C:\Users\jobro\Desktop\FastNoiseLiteFunctionLibrary"

# Set Output Folder Path (IE: Desktop File Path)
$outputRoot = "C:\Users\jobro\Desktop"

# Set versioned output folder base name (e.g., "Example" -> "Example_5.3")
$outputName = "FNSFuncLib"

# Validate required input values
